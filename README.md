# Governmentality 2025

*A Public Record of Governance, Preparedness, and Decision-Making in Ireland*

---

## Overview

**Governmentality 2025** is a publicly accessible evidential repository preserving a snapshot of the Irish State’s governance record during the period **2008–2025**. The repository documents a multi-decade failure to engage with **Operations Research (O.R.)**—a discipline essential for lawful decision-making under uncertainty in defence, public health, and national infrastructure.

What began as a technical proposal matured, through repeated notice and non-response, into a **structural indictment** of institutional evasion, designed delay, and the systematic suppression of applied intelligence.

## Legal Footnotes and Authorities
The repository is grounded in the following pillars:

1.  **Constitutional Obligations**: The right to petition Parliament under **Article 15.10** and the executive authority vested in the Government under **Article 28** of *Bunreacht na hÉireann*.[^1]
2.  **Ethics in Public Office Act 1995**: Specifically **Section 8(2)** regarding complaints against members and **Section 8(3)** regarding statutory duties of disclosure and ethical conduct.[^2]
3.  **Standing Orders**: Dáil Standing Order **162(3)(d)** and Seanad Standing Order **145(3)(d)**, which govern the receipt and processing of formal complaints regarding member conduct.
4.  **Administrative Law**: The **Ministers and Secretaries Acts** and the **Cabinet Handbook**, which articulate the collective responsibility of Cabinet and the duty of oversight in national preparedness.
5.  **Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013**: Cited as the mechanism to compel the discharge of statutory duties where maladministration is established.[^3]
6.  **Good Administration**: Derived from EU principles, requiring "substantive acknowledgment" of expert submissions rather than "simulated process" or "formulaic responses".[^4]
7.  **Data Protection & Privacy**: Redacted Personal Dispatches.[^5]

## Status
This repository is a **historical snapshot of 2025**. It is preserved as a fixed record to prevent the retroactive dilution or revision of the evidential trail.

*This repository shifts the burden of proof to the State, treating the pervasive, self-preserving non-responsiveness as the primary breach of fiduciary duty.*
